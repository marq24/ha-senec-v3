# Charge your Storage/Battery/Accumulator from grid when stock price is low

![Example Dashboard Setup](../../images/storage_board.png)

As a Tibber customer, I am paying the stock market price based on my hourly consumption. Additionally, I own 
a 12 kWh Senec storage/battery 'system', that will be charged by default via my PV. But I can also load power from the
grid and use the energy later (with a loss - energy input != energy output). But depending on the price gap it still can
be worth to load the storage with grid power!

In the past weeks I spend some time with finding a way to charge my storage/battery via HA automations when the price is
low but also consider other aspects (like expected PV production) as well.

_Please note, that this guide requires some basic knowledge about Home Assistant and some manual steps that are not very
comfortable. But I hope it will help you to get started._

## Requirements / Preparation
### A Tibber price entity (REST API)
Probably you have already such an entry in your HA configuration (double check, if your structor is equivalent). If not,
all you need is a token from Tibber and the following configuration in your `configuration.yaml` file:

_Please note, if you have already a `sensor` section in your configuration, then you don't need to the first line
(`sensor:`) again._
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: rest
    name: "Tibber stock prices"
    unique_id: tibber_stock_prices
    resource: https://api.tibber.com/v1-beta/gql
    method: POST
    payload: '{ "query": "{ viewer { homes { currentSubscription { status priceInfo(resolution: QUARTER_HOURLY) { today { total startsAt level} tomorrow { total startsAt level} } } } } }" }'
    json_attributes_path: "$.data.viewer.homes[0].currentSubscription.priceInfo"
    json_attributes:
      - today
      - tomorrow
    value_template: "{{ value_json.data.viewer.homes[0].currentSubscription.priceInfo.today[0].total | float }}"
    # we will update this integration via an automation - so no need of a scan_interval?!
    # at least every 24h (=60sec * 60min * 24h = 86400)
    scan_interval: 86400
    headers:
      Authorization: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
      Content-Type: application/json
      User-Agent: REST
    unit_of_measurement: €/kWh
```
Where `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` (in the headers section) must be replaced with your token, that you can
generate here: [https://developer.tibber.com/settings/accesstoken](https://developer.tibber.com/settings/accesstoken).

Additionally, I have added an HA automation triggering an update of my rest sensor every hour. __Please choose a
different slightly time delay, so that we do not overload (DOS) the Tibber API__:

```yaml
alias: "[POW] Update Tibber Stock Prices Entity"
description: >-
  Update the Tibber Stock Prices Entity [after 13:00 every 15 min if tomorrow is not present]
triggers:
  - trigger: time_pattern
    hours: /1
    minutes: /15
    seconds: "49"
conditions:
  - condition: or
    conditions:
      - condition: and
        conditions:
          - condition: time
            after: "13:00:00"
          - condition: template
            value_template: >
              {{(state_attr('sensor.tibber_stock_prices', 'tomorrow')) | length == 0}}
      - condition: and
        conditions:
          - condition: time
            before: "00:35:00"
          - condition: template
            value_template: >
              {{(state_attr('sensor.tibber_stock_prices', 'tomorrow')) | length > 0}}
actions:
  - data: {}
    target:
      entity_id: sensor.tibber_stock_prices
    action: homeassistant.update_entity
mode: single
```

Make sure, that after a HA restart you have a `sensor.tibber_stock_prices` entity in your HA entities list (e.g. Developer
Tools -> States).

### A Solar production forcast entity
In order to be able to judge, if your storage could not be loaded with expected PV energy the code must be able to get
the info how much kWh are expected for the current day.

I use here https://www.home-assistantio/integrations/forecast_solar/ to get the information. Since I have installed PV
on EAST and WEST side of my roof, I have two entities in my HA entities list and creaded a template sensor to sum up
both values.

### The Tibber Integration providing some price data for your home
Finally the last thing you need an entity that will be provided by the Tibber integration
istelf: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tibber

## Installation
### Step 1: Collect your entities
In order to use all the stuff you must collect your local entity names:

- The Tibber stock price entity (e.g. `sensor.tibber_stock_prices`)
- The Tibber home electricity price entity (e.g. `sensor.electricity_price_mmphome`)
- The Solar production forecast entity (e.g. `energy_production_today_remaining_sum`)
- The SOC (State of Charge) of your storage/battery (e.g. `sensor.senec_battery_charge_percent`)

Please store these information (e.g. in a clipboard) since we going to need this info multiple times in the next steps - like this:
```
sensor.tibber_stock_prices
sensor.electricity_price_mmphome
sensor.energy_production_today_remaining_sum
sensor.senec_battery_charge_percent
```

### Step 2: Get the files...
You need to get the two files `pow_sensors.yaml` and `pow_vars.jinja2` here from github:
- [pow_sensors.yaml](https://github.com/marq24/ha-senec-v3/raw/refs/heads/master/docs/battery_control/pow_sensors.yaml)
    
  Store this file in your HA configuration directory under `config` directory.

 
- [pow_vars.jinja](https://github.com/marq24/ha-senec-v3/raw/refs/heads/master/docs/battery_control/pow_vars.jinja)

  Store this file in your HA configuration directory in a subdirectory called `custom_templates` in your `config`
  directory. If such a `custom_templates` directory does not exist (which is very likly), create it first.

from the `custom_templates` and `config` directory of this repository and copy them to your HA configuration directory.

### Step 3: Adjustments 
#### Your HA `configuration.yaml` file [in `config` directory]
If you haven't already a `homeassistant` section in your `configuration.yaml` file, then you can add the following lines
to it (if you have already such a section just add the package):
```yaml
...
homeassistant:
  packages:
    power_calc: !include pow_sensors.yaml
...
```

#### The `pow_sensors.yaml` file [in `config` directory]

Open the `pow_sensors.yaml` file (e.g. with nano) and adjust the state triggers. The list of entities that will cause an update of the states of the entities in the `pow_sensors.yaml` file.

Just take the block you have created in step 1 and paste it into the `pow_sensors.yaml` file [and don't forget to use the right intent and don't forget the `-` (dash)] 

```yaml
...  
  - trigger:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id:
          - sensor.tibber_stock_prices
          - sensor.electricity_price_mmphome
          - sensor.senec_battery_charge_percent
          - sensor.energy_production_today_remaining_sum
...
```
The save the file and close the editor.

#### The `pow_vars.jinja2` file [in `config/custom_templates` directory]
Open the `pow_vars.jinja2` file (e.g. with nano) and adjust the upper part containing all your local configuration. You
can keep the default's but you must adjust the sensor entity section!

```yaml
{% set tibb_prices_rest_sensor = 'sensor.tibber_stock_prices' %}
{% set your_tibber_home_sensor = 'sensor.electricity_price_mmphome' %}
{% set your_pv_prognose_sensor = 'sensor.energy_production_today_remaining_sum' %}
{% set your_storage_soc_sensor = 'sensor.senec_battery_charge_percent' %}
...
```

The other part that you want to adjust are the average home consumption values. The script can use different values for
day and nighttime (e.g. here @ my home the heatpump is not running during the night). All values are in  kW/h. (and must
be estimated by you:

```yaml
...
{% set kw_per_hour_average = "1.225"|float %}
{% set kw_per_hour_day = "1.5"|float %}
{% set kw_per_hour_night = "0.4"|float %}
{% set day_start = "5"|int %}
{% set day_end = "22"|int %}
...
```
If you don't want to use this feature, just set the `kw_per_hour_day` value to your average energy consumption per hour
and set `day_start = "0"|int` & `day_end = "0"|int`). The `kw_per_hour_average` value will be only used in fallback
scenarios.

__Do not edit the rest of the file (below the lines)!__
```yaml
...
{# ############################ #}
{# END-OF-CONFIGURATION-OPTIONS #}
{# ############################ #}
{# DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE  #}
{# ############################ #}
...
```

The save the file and close the editor.

### Step 4: Restart HA
After the restart check the log's if there are any errors. If not, you should see a bunch of new (template) entities in your HA

### Step 5: Create an example Dashboard
![Example Dashboard Setup](../../images/storage_board.png)

So you can see all the different calculated values in one place in order to be able to judge yourself if the automations
that will fire in the expected conditions. 

This example dashboard requires the `custom:multiple-entity-row` card! https://github.com/benct/lovelace-multiple-entity-row
```yaml

### Step 6: Finally - Adding the automations
#### START
Start Storage loading when price is low (please note that the is currently no price check included!) - obviously you
need a different switch (at the end) when you don't use this with the Senec HA integration:

```yaml
alias: "[POW] Load Storage [ON] when price is low (and remaining PV production is not sufficent)" 
description: ""
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id:
      - binary_sensor.pow_now_in_low_price_phase
      - binary_sensor.pow_pv_power_can_fully_load_storage
      - binary_sensor.pow_now_in_cheapest_phase
      - sensor.pow_low_price_duration
  - trigger: time_pattern
    hours: /1
    minutes: "1"
conditions: []
actions:
  - if:
      - condition: template
        value_template: >-
          {{ states('switch.senec_safe_charge')|lower == 'off' and (
            (states('binary_sensor.pow_now_in_low_price_phase')|lower == 'on') or
            (states('binary_sensor.pow_now_in_cheapest_phase')|lower == 'on')
          ) and
          states('binary_sensor.pow_pv_power_can_fully_load_storage')|lower == 'off' and
          states('sensor.pow_storage_full_charge_duration')|int > 0.49
          and (
            (states('binary_sensor.pow_now_in_cheapest_phase')|lower == 'on') or
            (states('sensor.pow_storage_full_charge_duration') >= states('sensor.pow_low_price_duration'))
          )}}
    then:
      - entity_id: switch.senec_safe_charge
        action: switch.turn_on
mode: single
trace:
  stored_traces: 100

```
#### STOP
Stop Storage loading (and allow that energy from the storage can be used) when price is high - obviously you need a
different switch (at the end) when you don't use this with the Senec HA integration:

```yaml
alias: "[POW] Load Storage [OFF] when price is high (or remaining PV production is sufficent)"
description: ""
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id:
      - binary_sensor.pow_now_in_high_price_storage_independent_phase
      - binary_sensor.pow_pv_power_can_fully_load_storage
  - trigger: time_pattern
    hours: /1
    minutes: 0
    seconds: 45
conditions: []
actions:
  - if:
      - condition: template
        value_template: |-
          {{ states('switch.senec_safe_charge')|lower == 'on' and (
            states('binary_sensor.pow_now_in_high_price_storage_independent_phase')|lower == 'on' or
            states('binary_sensor.pow_now_in_high_price_phase')|lower == 'on' or
            states('binary_sensor.pow_pv_power_can_fully_load_storage')|lower =='on'
          ) }}
    then:
      - entity_id: switch.senec_safe_charge
        action: switch.turn_off
mode: single
trace:
  stored_traces: 100
```
