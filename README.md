# Home Assistant Integration for SENEC.Home V2.x/V3/V4 Systems

This fork was created from [mchwalisz/home-assistant-senec](https://gitgub.com/mchwalisz/home-assistant-senec) mainly
because I wanted additional fields and some configuration options (like polling interval). Since I own a
__SENEC.Home V3 hybrid duo__ I can __only test my adjustments in such a configuration__.

But this does not imply, that this Integration is working only with V3 systems. The Integration should work with
multiple SENEC.Home Systems based on local `lala.cgi` calls.

Have that said - the __SENEC.Home V4__ will not come with a build-in web server that can be polled from your LAN. So
in order to support V4 this integration is polling (a limited amount of) data from the mein-senec.de web portal. The
__available data is__ (currently) __limited__ (only 13 sensor entities) and will be polled with a fix interval of 5
minutes.

__Thanks to [@mstuettgen](https://github.com/mstuettgen) developing the initial SENEC.Home V4 web-access! I hope you
support this repo in the future with possible enhancements for the WEB-API__.

## __Use this fork on your own risk!__

## Modifications (compared to the original version) in this fork

- Added User accessible configuration option
- Added configurable _update interval_ for the sensor data (I use _5_ seconds, without any issue)
- Reading DeviceID, DeviceType, BatteryType & Version information
- Added WebAPI access in order to support SENEC.Home V4
  Systems - [kudos @mstuettgen for the initial work!](https://github.com/mstuettgen/homeassistant-addons/tree/main/senecweb2mqtt)

  This WebAPI access is also usable for all other SENEC.Home Systems where the total-statistics data have been removed
  with the latest update by SENEC

  Please note, that currently the polling interval of 5 minutes is hardcoded!

- Additional Sensors:
    - For each MPP1, MPP2, MPP3 [potential (V), current (A) & power (W)]
    - For your EnFluRi-Net (Freq, potential, current, power)
    - For your EnFluRi-Usage (Freq, potential, current, power) [disabled by default]

    - Added BatteryCell Details [mainly disabled by default]
        - Module [A-D]: Current/Voltage/State of Charge (SoC)/State of Health (SoH)/Cycles
        - Cell temperature [1-6] per module [A-D]
        - Voltage per cell [1-14] per module [A-D]

    - Added Wallbox Details  [disabled by default]

    - If you connect the internal Inverter [in the case of the Duo there are even two (LV & HV)] to your LAN (see
      [details below](#inv-lnk)), then you can add these additional instances and directly access the data from the
      DC-AC
      converters

- Added Switch(es):
    - Added a switch to manually load the battery [state: 'MAN. SAFETY CHARGE' & 'SAFETY CHARGE READY'] (obviously this
      will use additional power from grid when your PV inverters will not provide enough power)

      _This switche might sound very foolish - but if you are not subscribed to the (IMHO total overpriced) SENEC-Cloud
      electricity tariff __and__ you have been smart and signed up for a dynamic price model (based on the current stock
      price) then loading your battery when the price is the lowest during the day might become a smart move (and also
      disallow battery usage while the price is average). Specially during the winter!_

    - EXPERIMENTAL: Added a switch to enable 'storage mode' [state: LITHIUM SAFE MODE DONE'] [disabled by default]

      The functionality of this switch is currently __not known__ - IMHO this will disable the functionality of the PV!
      __Please Note, that once enabled and then disable again the system will go into the 'INSULATION TEST' mode__ for a
      short while (before returning to normal operation)

- Modified _battery_charge_power_ & _battery_discharge_power_ so that they will only return data >0 when the system
  state is matching the corresponding CHARGE or DISCHARGE state (including state variants)

- Integrated variant of _pysenec_ python lib (almost every modification of this Home Assistant integration requires also
  an adjustment in the lib) - yes of course it would be possible to release also a lib derivative - but right now I am
  just a python beginner, and __I am lazy!__

- Added German Setup/GUI "translation" (not for the sensor's yet)

- Added support to read and update the spare capacity ("Notstromreserve")
    - When you are using "SENEC Backup Power pro" and you are able to see and update the spare capacity at mein-senec.de, than you can read and update the spare capacity with this integration.
    - Precondition: You are using the Web Api
    - Since the functionallity is disabled by default, navigate to Settings -> Devices & Services, select the Senec Integration and click on the entities of the Web API.
    Here you can activate the "Spare Capacity". 
    Once activated you can add the entity to your dashboard. When you click on the shown spare capacity on your dashboard a slider will be shown. With this slider you can change the spare capacity. The chance will automatically be synchronized with mein-senec.de


## Switching to this fork...

Please find in all information you need to know
when [Switching [to this] Fork](https://github.com/marq24/ha-senec-v3/issues/14) here in this overview

## Installation

### Hacs

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

- Install [Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)](https://hacs.xyz/)
- Add custom repository https://github.com/marq24/ha-senec-v3 to HACS
- Add integration repository (search for "SENEC.Home" in "Explore & Download Repositories")

#### Manual

Add custom integration using the web interface and follow instruction on screen.

## Connecting the internal (build in) Senec Inverter Hardware to your LAN and use it in HA

The __SENEC.Home V3 hybrid duo__ have build in two inverters - called LV and HV. This hardware has its own LAN
connectors, but they have not been connected during the installation process (I guess by purpose).

### __DO THIS ON YOUR OWN RISK!__

Nevertheless, when you dismount the front and the right hand side panels you simply can plug in RJ45 LAN cables into
both of the inverters LAN connectors and after a short while you should be able to access the web frontends of the
inverters via your browser.

_Don't forget to assign fixed IP's to the additional inverter hardware. You can unplug the LAN cable for a short while
in order to make sure that the inverters will make use of the fixed assigned IP's._

### Position of SENEC.Inverter V3 LV LAN connector

On the front of the device

### Position of SENEC.Inverter V3 HV LAN connector _(hybrid duo only!)_

![img|160x90](images/inv_hv.png)
On the right hand side of the device

### Adding Inverter(s) to your HA

Once you have connected the inverter(s) with your LAN you can add another integration entry to your Senec Integration in
Home Assistant:

1. go to '__Settings__' -> '__Devices & Services__'
2. select the '__SENEC.Home__' integration.
3. there you find the '__Add Entry__' button (at the bottom of the '__Integration entries__' list)
4. specify the IP (or hostname) of the inverter you want to add
5. __important:__ assign a name (e.g. _INV_LV_).

Repeat step 3, 4 & 5 of this procedure, if you have build in two inverters into your Senec.HOME.

## Home Assistant Energy Dashboard

This integration supports Home Assistant's [Energy Management](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/energy/)
