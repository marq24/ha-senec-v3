> [!WARNING]
> ## Disclaimer for WebAPI Based Integration
> ### SENEC WebAPI can break at any time — and there might be no fix!
> SENEC does not provide any kind of public accessible API and/or documentation. The WebAPI can break at any time without notice. This means that the integration might stop working at any time, and there might be no fix available. Please be aware of this before using the WebAPI based integration.
>  
> You __should <ins>not</ins> make yourself <ins>dependent</ins> on the WebAPI based integration__, as it might not work in the future. If you want to use the WebAPI based integration, please be aware that __you are using it at your own risk__.
> 
> I must admit that <ins>__I am not sure__</ins> if the WebAPI-Integration version <ins>__is available in the future__</ins>. it might be just coincident, but the latest changes in the infrastructure by SENEC __might indicate__ that SENEC is __actively working on blocking custom implementations__.

## Setup / Installation

### Step I: Install the integration

#### Option 1: via HACS

- Install [Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)](https://hacs.xyz/)
- Add integration repository (search for "SENEC.Home" in "Explore & Download Repositories")
- Use the 3-dots at the right of the list entry (not at the top bar!) to download/install the custom integration — the latest release version is automatically selected. Only select a different version if you have specific reasons.
- After you press download and the process has completed, you must __Restart Home Assistant__ to install all dependencies
- Setup the custom integration as described below (see _Step II: Adding or enabling the integration_)

__If you only find__ the `Senec solar system sensor` integration (which will not work any longer!) - please add this repo as custom repository https://github.com/marq24/ha-senec-v3 to HACS

#### Option 2: manual steps

- Copy all files from `custom_components/senec/` to `custom_components/senec/` inside your config Home Assistant directory.
- Restart Home Assistant to install all dependencies
 
### Step II: Adding or enabling the integration

__You must have installed the integration (manually or via HACS before)!__

#### Option 1: My Home Assistant (2021.3+)

Just click the following Button to start the configuration automatically (for the rest see _Option 2: Manually steps by step_):

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=senec)

#### Option 2: Manually step by step

Use the following steps for a manual configuration by adding the custom integration using the web interface and follow instruction on screen:

- Go to `Configuration -> Integrations` and add "SENEC.Home" integration
- Select the Integration Type (basically LAN ot WebApi)
- LAN: (`SENEC.Home V3 hybrid/SENEC.Home V3 hybrid duo` or `SENEC.Home V2.1 or older`
  or `Internal inverter build into SENEC.Home V3 hybrid/hybrid duo`)
    - Provide display name for the device and its address (hostname or IP)
    - Provide the update interval
    - Provide the area where the battery is located
- WebAPI (`WEB.API: mein-senec.de Portal (usable with all SENEC.Home variants)`
  or `SENEC.Home V4/SENEC.Home V4 hybrid`):
    - Provide display name for the device
    - Provide your mein-senec.de login credentials

You can repeat this to add additional Integration entries (e.g. LAN + WebAPI)

### Switch to Tibber!

Are you still a customer of (IMHO totally overpriced) SENEC.Cloud as an electricity provider? Be smart switch to Tibber - that's what I did in october 2023.

If you want to join Tibber (become a customer), you might want to use my personal invitation link. When you use this link, Tibber will grant you and me a bonus of 50,-€ for each of us. This bonus then can be used in the Tibber store (not for your power bill) — e.g., to buy a Tibber Bridge. If you are already a Tibber customer and have not used an invitation link yet, you can also enter one afterward in the Tibber App (up to 14 days). [[see official Tibber support article](https://support.tibber.com/en/articles/4601431-tibber-referral-bonus#h_ae8df266c0)]

Please consider [using my personal Tibber invitation link to join Tibber today](https://invite.tibber.com/6o0kqvzf) or Enter the following code: 6o0kqvzf (six, oscar, zero, kilo, quebec, victor, zulu, foxtrot) afterward in the Tibber App - TIA!

## Switching to this fork

If you used previously the source of this fork created by [@mchwalisz](https://github.com/mchwalisz), please look at "[Switching [to this] Fork](https://github.com/marq24/ha-senec-v3/issues/14)", before using this integration.

## Want to report an issue?

Please use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/marq24/ha-senec-v3/issues) for reporting any issues you encounter with this integration. Please be so kind before creating a new issues, check the closed ones, if your problem have been already reported (& solved). Furthermore, I would kindly ask you to check:

#### 1. Consider providing DEBUG Log output
There is a short [tutorial/guide 'How to provide DEBUG log' here](docs/HA_DEBUG.md) - please take the time to quickly go through it. [open link from external (HACS)](https://github.com/marq24/ha-senec-v3/blob/master/docs/HA_DEBUG.md)

#### 2. In case of implausible data 
It will happen, that the data that is displayed by this integration does not make much sense (to you) - Of course this could be always the case, that something in this integration has been messed up - but so far - in all reported issues the root cause of implausible data was/is, that the SENEC.Home device itself already provided this data. So we have the SHIT-__IN__ - SHIT-__OUT__ principle here.

So when you have implausible data - please open in the case of the local polling integration  `https://[YOUR-SENEC-IP-HERE]//vars.html` (the two `/` before the `vars.html` are important) and check, if the values are already implausible there. For the WebAPI integration, check the SENEC-App or use `https://mein-senec.de`.


## Functional Overview

### Supported Devices

The following devices are currently supported:

| Device                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SENEC.HOME&nbsp;V2.x   | You can use the features and sensors provided by your device via the local polling (via lala.cgi) and the Web API (via mein-senec.de)                                                                                                                                           | 
| SENEC.HOME&nbsp;V3     | You can use the features and sensors provided by your device via the local polling (via lala.cgi) and the Web API (via mein-senec.de)                                                                                                                                           | 
| SENEC.HOME&nbsp;V4     | Since the device does not provide local access via a build in webserver, you can just use the features and sensors provided via the Web API (via mein-senec.de).                                                                                                                | 
| SENEC.Inverter&nbsp;V3 | [When you have connected the internal inverter(s) with your LAN](#build-in-inverters), you will be able to access information via the Local API. Please see: "Connecting the internal (build in) SENEC Inverter Hardware to your LAN and use it in HA" for further information. | 

### Local Polling

The following features and sensors are provided by polling the build in webserver of your SENEC device: Since this is a long list, not everything is enabled by default.

To enable a disabled function or sensor navigate to Settings -> Devices and Services, select the integration and click "configuration" of the device. In the list you can see the status and have also the option to enable/disable them.

#### Features

|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Load Battery         | With this switch you can load the battery manually                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | yes                |
| Lithium Storage Mode | EXPERIMENTAL: Switch to enable 'storage mode' [state: LITHIUM SAFE MODE DONE'] [disabled by default]. The functionality of this switch is currently __not known__ - IMHO this will disable the functionality of the PV! __Please Note, that once enabled and then disable again the system will go into the 'INSULATION TEST' mode__ for a short while (before returning to normal operation) | no                 |
| Wallbox I-IV Control | Requires the additionally the WebAPI to be installed - [please see the separate section for details](#wb-control)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | no                 |

### Wallbox Control

Without this integration owners of a SENEC wallbox, __must__ use the SENEC mobile app in order to control the wallbox device. This 'remote-control-functionality' implies, that it takes a certain amount of time till a change in the mobile app will be synced with your local device. I was not aware of this 'delay'-situation (since I do not have a wallbox installed - and probably I will not get one from SENEC). At the end of December (2023) I was contacted by Sigurd L. and was asked, if it would be possible to support wallbox control with this SENEC.Home Integration.

The challenge for the integration is, that on the one hand it has to be ensured that the appropriate values in the local SENEC device will be set and make sure on the other hand that at the same time, that also the corresponding adjustments will be done in the SENEC Backend infrastructure (where the mobile app going to make the adjustments). And of course all that have to be done without any documentation and a really wired mix of parameter names - so please __use this functionality on your own risk!__.

When the Integration would adjust the wallbox setting in the local SENEC device __only__, then these changes will be reverted/overwritten after a short while with the data provided by the central SENEC backend. So this Home Assistant integration will set values in your local SENEC device as well as via the APP-API (web based) __simultaneously__ - so that the central SENEC backend and your local SENEC device are in sync.

Please Note: When you're going to adjust the Wallbox setting via the SENEC mobile app, your local SENEC device will still get synced with these adjustments after a short while (typically 5minutes). In such a case the values in the Home Assistant Integration will be also updated to your 'remote' adjustments.

#### Supported wallbox control features:

- Select the current Wallbox Mode: LOCKED / FASTEST / OPTIMIZED
- When Mode OPTIMIZED is active you can adjust the charging current (IC_MAX)
- When FASTEST is enabled you can switch 'allow intercharge' (use energy from your SENEC battery)

#### Setup requirements

When you want to control your wallbox via Home Assistant and this integration, you need to configure:

1. the __LAN__: `SENEC.Home V3 hybrid/SENEC.Home V3 hybrid duo` or `SENEC.Home V2.1 or older` __and__
2. also the __WebAPI__: `mein-senec.de Portal (usable with all SENEC.Home variants)`

__Only__ if both components are configured the Wallbox Control can work correctly!

# There is even more...

Here you will find additional information regarding setup and configuration.

<a href="build-in-inverters"/></a>

## Connecting the internal (build in) SENEC Inverter Hardware to your LAN and use it in HA

The __SENEC.Home V3 hybrid duo__ have build in two inverters - called LV and HV. This hardware has its own LAN connectors, but they have not been connected during the installation process (I guess by purpose).

### __DO THIS ON YOUR OWN RISK!__

Nevertheless, when you dismount the front and the right hand side panels you simply can plug in RJ45 LAN cables into both of the inverters LAN connectors and after a short while you should be able to access the web frontends of the inverters via your browser.

_Don't forget to assign fixed IP's to the additional inverter hardware. You can unplug the LAN cable for a short while in order to make sure that the inverters will make use of the fixed assigned IP's._

### Position of SENEC.Inverter V3 LV LAN connector

![img|160x90](images/inv_lv.png)
On the front of the device

### Position of SENEC.Inverter V3 HV LAN connector _(hybrid duo only!)_

![img|160x90](images/inv_hv.png)
On the right hand side of the device

### Adding Inverter(s) to your HA

Once you have connected the inverter(s) with your LAN you can add another integration entry to your SENEC Integration in Home Assistant:

1. go to '__Settings__' -> '__Devices & Services__'
2. select the '__SENEC.Home__' integration.
3. there you find the '__Add Entry__' button (at the bottom of the '__Integration entries__' list)
4. select `Internal inverter build into SENEC.Home V3 hybrid/hybrid duo` from the list
5. specify the IP (or hostname) of the inverter you want to add
6. __important:__ assign a name (e.g. _INV_LV_).

Repeat step 3, 4 & 5 of this procedure, if you have build in two inverters into your SENEC.Home.

## Reduce the footprint of your WebAPI integration

When you are using the WebAPI integration, you might like to reduce the footprint of the WebAPI integration at SENECs infrastructure. E.g. after sunset the PV production becomes zero, and so you might want to reduce the frequency in which the integration will query the WebAPI.

> [!NOTE]
> When you want to make use of this feature, you must obviously configure the update interval of the WebAPI integration to your minimum update frequency you would like to use.
> 
> So when you configure the WebAPI integration to update every 10 minutes, and you select `Every 5 minutes` in the Request Throttling Select entity, then the WebAPI integration will still update only every 10 minutes.

### Example automation to reduce the WebAPI footprint when the sun is down

> [!NOTE]
> The select `entity_id` might be different in your ha installation.

```yaml
alias: Reduce WebAPI footprint
description: "When the sun is down, reduce the frequency of the WebAPI polling to 2 hours / and restore it on sunrise to 5 minutes"
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id:
      - sun.sun
conditions: []
actions:
  - if:
      - condition: sun
        after: sunrise
    then:
      - action: select.select_option
        data:
          option: five_minutes
        target:
          entity_id: select.senec_webapi_request_throttling
  - if:
      - condition: sun
        after: sunset
    then:
      - action: select.select_option
        data:
          option: two_hours
        target:
          entity_id: select.senec_webapi_request_throttling

Here is the complete list of available options for the WebAPI `request_throttling` select entity:
- no_limit

## Using the Home Assistant Energy Dashboard

This integration supports Home Assistant's [Energy Management](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/energy/).
To be able to use the Energy Dashboard __please set up the Web-API first__ or __use the Riemann Sum Integal Platform to create corresponding sensors__.

Please check also the following links for details about the use of the [Riemann Sum Integal Platform (describing the problem a bit more in detail)](https://github.com/marq24/ha-senec-v3/issues/4) and [How to configure Energie Dashboards (after SENEC.Home have been updated to 0825+)](https://github.com/marq24/ha-senec-v3/issues/11).

In the description of the Web-API you will see which sensors you can use for the Energy Dashboard.

Example setup:

## In winter: charge your SENEC Battery from grid (when stock price is low)

When your grid supply depends on the hourly electricity price on the stock exchange, then it might be smart in the winter time (when almost no PV power is available) to charge your SENEC system with power from grid. If you are a little bit deeper into HA automations you might like to use my scripts to control the charging and discharging of your battery.

See all the details in the [LOAD YOUR BATTERY_WITH_TIBBER](https://github.com/marq24/ha-senec-v3/blob/master/docs/battery_control/BATTERY_WITH_TIBBER.md).

|[@marq24](https://github.com/marq24)| @marq24 created this fork, e.g. added several sensors and functions and is maintaining the integration.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|[@mstuettgen](https://github.com/mstuettgen)| Provided the initial WEB-API implementation for SENEC.Home V4 web access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|[@io-debug](https://github.com/io-debug)| Provided the initial developer documentation and added functionality like the spare capacity management.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|[@mchwalisz](https://github.com/mchwalisz)| This fork was created from [mchwalisz/home-assistant-senec](https://github.com/mchwalisz/home-assistant-senec)<br/>After some firmware updates in 2023 (by SENEC) this original integration simply does not work any longer - plus: we needed more detailed information and configuration options |
